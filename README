MAIN
The program will generate a loop that ends when the exit status reaches the    
value 1. Each step of the loop consists of reading the command from STDIN and
separating the raw command from the parameters(example: command = "LOAD a.in",
raw command = "LOAD" parameter "a.in") and executing the command.The separation
is realised with the aid of strtok which can keep in it's buffer the
parameters.The exit status becomes 1 when the exit command is given.

LOAD
The execution of this command is separated into 2 stages:
-reading metadata:reading the information about the construction of the map(
such as the file format, the dimensions of the map,etc)
-reading the map(the actual image made of pixels) : reading the values assigned
to each pixel
The map is dynamically allocated as a matrix of pixels.Each pixel is in fact
a dynamically allocated vector of values(each value being the intensity of the
component colors).The ASCII format images will be read with fscanf as
decimal numbers,whilst the binary ones will be read as characters and assigned
directly to an integer(the implicit conversion is favorable in this case).

SELECT
The new coordinates will be read from the strtok buffer and kept in the 
structure of type image.This command represents both SELECT coordinates
and SELECT ALL.

ROTATE
The rotation will be realised by rotating the area or image by 90 degrees for
several times.In case of full image rotation the new map will be represented
in a new location and the old one will be cleared by freeing the memory that
contains it.In case of area rotation, the new area will be represented in a 
statically allocated matrix and copied into the original map afterwards.

CROP
The cropped map will be represented in a new location and the old location will
be freed.

GRAYSCALE & SEPIA
Each value will be modified according to the formula.

SAVE
This command will be executed similarly to the LOAD command.Thus,the metadata
will be first written in the output file and then the map.The way each type of
image was read in the LOAD command is the way it will be written into the
output file.But, the type of the written image will be read from the second
parameter which can be ascii or none(binary).The out file is closed right after
the command is executed.

EXIT
The map is freed, the in file closed and the exit status turns 1.
